AEHFolder - Rscript for calculating the average expected heterozygosity (AEH) of groups, and an Rscript for graphing the AEH distribution.
Allele Frequency Files - Folder of group allele frequencies used in the study. Groups are named by their respective AEHs.
CorrectReferenceAnalysis - Rscripts used to create data visualizations for correctly specified reference group simulations.
FSTFolder - Python script and necessary input files used to reduce the number of groups used in the study. Used to identify the most different groups, which are then used in the incorrect reference group simulations.
GroupQualityControlFolder - Scripts used to ensure that groups used in the study pass the quality control checks.
IncorrectReferenceAnalysis - Rscripts used to create data visualizations for incorrectly specified reference group simulations.
SimulationScripts - Scripts and necessary input files used to simulate DNA mixture analysis through the Forensim package.
