###READ ME - Cross Analysis Data Visualization Scripts###

This section is the README for the following scripts:
Cross_Analysis_Heatmap.R
FBI_FPR_Heatmaps.R
InMix_Heatmaps.R*

Function: The purpose of these scripts are to visualize all of the misspecified reference group results. 
The scripts identify the groups used in the analysis and reads the results from those analyses. For a given
set of misspecified reference group simulations, it calculates the percentage of simulations where the log(LR)
was greater than 0 (in other words, the false positive rate). This process repeats until all results are read in,
then compiled into a single dataframe. Groups are renamed to their respective genetic diversity values, then the
dataframe is converted to an array. An initial heatmap can be generated at this point, which sorts groups by their
genetic diversities. Groups can also be sorted by their FST values, which requires a dendrogram to be made and 
included in the final heatmap.

###UNDERSTANDING THE SCRIPT###

#Setup#
In order to run the script, the following packages are required:
stringr
reshape2
tidyverse
tidyr
ggplot2
ggdendro
grid
gridExtra
cowplot

The following files are required:
FSTarray - a matrix where the rows and columns are the groups and the cells are their respective FST values.
pops_26 - this is a file that specifies which groups are used in the misspecified reference group analysis.
pops_aeh_sorted - this is a file that has all the groups organized by their genetic diversities.

Creating the dataframe:
The script first loads the packages and then sets the correct directory. It identifies the groups of interest, then gathers
the results of the analysis one simulation group at a time. This is done by reading in one file at a time, calculating the 
false positive rate by summing all log(LR) > 0, then dividing by the total number of simulations. After storing the results,
it moves on to the next simulation group until the results of all simulation groups are compiled. Lastly, the results are converted
into a matrix.

Renaming the groups:
Groups are renamed to their respective genetic diversities, and the genetic diversities are shortened to 5 significant figures.

Creating the heatmap:
The matrix is converted to an array using the pivot_longer() function. This allows us to then use ggplot2’s geom_tile function
to generate a heatmap where the rows and columns are the group’s genetic diversities in order, and the fill are the false 
positive rates.

Adding a dendrogram:
Optionally, a dendrogram may be supplied if the user wishes to create a heatmap where groups are sorted by their FST values. 
This is done by creating a dendrogram of the groups using their FST values. A visual dendrogram is generated via ggplot2’s 
ggdendrogram() function. In order to align the dendrogram to the heatmap, we extract the order of the groups from the dendrogram,
then re-organize the groups of the heatmap accordingly. A new heatmap can now be generated with groups sorted by FST, though the 
size of the heatmap may need to be adjusted due to the addition of the dendrogram.

*Note that for the InMix_Heatmaps.R script, the logic is the same as above, except we are calculating for instances where log(LR) < 0,
and instead of false positive rate, we are calculating Power.
